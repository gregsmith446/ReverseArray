This code segment in Program.cs takes 2 inputs: 
an integer, which represents the size of an array
integers equal to the number given above.

The input is then added to an integer array.  The array is revered and using a foreach loop,
the contents of the array are printed to the console.

The output is thus the integer array in reverse order, as space separated ints.
